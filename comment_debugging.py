# the next line of code uses single quotes and throws an error
print('This line of code's wrong')

# but we can test by commenting out the line of code in question and changing it to include double quotes for the string
# print('This line of code's wrong') - this is an example of debugging using comments
print("This line of code's correct")

# also use CTRL-K-C to turn the current selected code line into a comment
# CTRL-K-U to un-comment
